Significant credit goes to Diego Carrion (0x783Czar on Github and other places) for assisting and mentoring in the development process. He is also directly responsible for the last_lines portion of well_web_app.py. Before his guidance, this was running on a apache server with three separate python modules, each which read and wrote data to memory. It worked, but not nearly as efficiently as it does now. Thanks, Diego.
